# README.md for Groupera Backend

## Overview

Welcome to the Groupera Backend! This is the heart of our project, a Node.js API built on Express. Groupera is all about
bringing people together, and our backend makes sure everything runs smoothly. Whether you're a developer diving into
the code or just curious about how things work, you've come to the right place.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v14 or later)
-   npm (v6 or later)
-   A soul for coding (just kidding, but enthusiasm helps!)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/groupera-backend.git
    ```
2. Enter the directory:
    ```bash
    cd groupera-backend
    ```
3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4. Create & update .env file by copying .env.example
    ```bash
    cp -R .env.example .env
    ```

### Running the Server

Run the server with:

```bash
npm start
```

The magic happens on `http://localhost:3000` by default!

## Features

## Code Quality: ESLint and Prettier

### ESLint
ESLint is our tool of choice for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript. It helps us maintain code quality and adhere to coding standards.

To run ESLint:

```bash
npm run lint
```

This command will check for any linting errors across the codebase. If you find any, try to fix them to keep the code clean and consistent!

### Configuring ESLint
Our ESLint configuration is defined in `.eslintrc.js`. Feel free to tweak the rules according to the project's coding standards.

### Prettier
Prettier is our code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing the code and reprinting it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.
To format your code with Prettier:

```bash
npm run format
```
This command will automatically format your code according to the predefined styles in the Prettier configuration.

### Configuring Prettier
The Prettier configuration is located in `.prettierrc`.
