# README.md for Groupera Backend

## Overview

Welcome to the Groupera Backend! This is the heart of our project, a Node.js API built on Express. Groupera is all about
bringing people together, and our backend makes sure everything runs smoothly. Whether you're a developer diving into
the code or just curious about how things work, you've come to the right place.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v14 or later)
-   npm (v6 or later)
-   A soul for coding (just kidding, but enthusiasm helps!)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/groupera-backend.git
    ```
2. Enter the directory:
    ```bash
    cd groupera-backend
    ```
3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4. Create & update .env file by copying .env.example
    ```bash
    cp -R .env.example .env
    ```
5. Create and seed your mongoDB database: [Go to DB setup](#-db-setup)

### Running the Server

Run the server with:

```bash
npm start
```

The magic happens on `http://localhost:3000` by default!

## Features

-   **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration.
-   **Group Management**: Create, edit, and manage groups.
-   **Event Scheduling**: Organize and keep track of events.
-   ...

## Code Quality: ESLint and Prettier

### ESLint
ESLint is our tool of choice for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript. It helps us maintain code quality and adhere to coding standards.

To run ESLint:

```bash
npm run lint
```

This command will check for any linting errors across the codebase. If you find any, try to fix them to keep the code clean and consistent!

### Configuring ESLint
Our ESLint configuration is defined in `.eslintrc.js`. Feel free to tweak the rules according to the project's coding standards.

### Prettier
Prettier is our code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing the code and reprinting it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.
To format your code with Prettier:

```bash
npm run format
```
This command will automatically format your code according to the predefined styles in the Prettier configuration.

### Configuring Prettier
The Prettier configuration is located in `.prettierrc`.

## DB setup
Alright, let's jazz up your README with some cool setup instructions for the MongoDB database and populating it with some dummy data using your seed.js. Here's how you can extend your README:

### MongoDB Atlas Setup

Before diving into the Groupera magic, you need a MongoDB database. We recommend using MongoDB Atlas because it's super easy and efficient. Here's how to get it rolling:

1. **Create an Atlas Account**: Head over to [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) and sign up for an account.

2. **Build a Cluster**: Once you're in, create a new cluster. This can be a free tier cluster for development purposes.

3. **Set Up Database Access**: Navigate to the 'Database Access' section. Create a new user with read and write privileges.

4. **Configure Network Access**: Go to the 'Network Access' section and add a new IP address. You can allow access from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0) for ease of development.

5. **Get Your Connection String**: Head to 'Clusters', click on 'Connect', choose 'Connect your application', and copy the provided connection string.

6. **Update Your .env File**: Replace the existing database URI in your .env file with the connection string you just copied. Don't forget to replace `<password>` with the database user's password.

### Populating the Database with Dummy Data

Now, let's fill this database with some dummy data to play with. This is where `seed.js` comes into the spotlight.

1. **Run the Seed Script**: To seed your database, simply run:

    ```bash
    npm run seed
    ```

2. **What's Happening?**: This script will populate your database with initial data, so you have some cool stuff to work with right away.

3. **Check the Database**: After running the script, you can check your database to see the dummy data. It's like magic, but you actually know how it's done!

## That's It!

You're all set! You've got your own MongoDB database running and it's filled with data. Time to start building amazing things with Groupera!
